File "main_NDEDA_public" is the main procedure

Noted that the subset repairing scheme is to modify the duplicate dfeature subsets. However, for some high-dimensional datasets, this step is quite time-consuming. If you want to compare with our method, you can jump the subset repairing scheme when the nunber of features in a dataset is over 500.
